						<h4>Creative Tensions is a conversation that moves.</h4>
						<p>Every bridge stands at the edge of a space we hope to cross: a gap between here and there. As women, what are the gaps separating us from where we want to go? Who will make the bridges we might need, and what shape should they take? And as we approach a crossing, is there comfort in keeping our distance from the other side?</p> 
						<p>Join us at <b>TEDWomen 2017: Bridges</b> for <i>Creative Tensions: What Lies In The Gap</i> to explore what we must collectively confront to close the gender gap.</p>

						<p><i>Creative Tensions</i> is not a  panel; it's a conversation that moves. Reflecting on a tension between two poles, participants reveal where they stand on an issue by where they stand&mdash;and move&mdash;in the room. Exploring topics that lie at the heart of what it means to be human, <i>Creative Tensions</i> is a fresh approach to group dialogue that encourages openness and inspires empathy.</p>

				<h1 class="title">It began as a conversation</h1>
				
				<div class="multi-columns"><p>When IDEO and the Sundance Institute Theatre Program sat down to collaborate, we immediately recognized a common desire to bring creativity to unexpected places. What unusual experience could we create together for our audiences? We decided to experiment by combining elements from each of our methods - empathy and observation from human centered design, movement and self-reflection from theater. The result is Creative Tensions, a unique live event series where participatory theater meets collective conversation.</p>
